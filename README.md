### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Node.js developer who loves working with Linux and FOSS technologies. Don't believe me? I'm a(n) ...

- [OpenJS Node.js Application Developer (JSNAD)](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/ae2d70bc-0d1f-43e4-b630-943548a3b5ac): valid thru August 2023

Since June 2020, I've been using Linux exclusively on my laptops: Fedora on my new (as of November 2020) Lenovo laptop (not the OEM ones, unfortunately) and Ubuntu on my MacBook Air + a 15-year old Sony Vaio. Before that, I've used macOS for 7 years (mid 2013 - mid 2020) and, once upon a time, Windows.

My work experience can be summarized as follows:

- M-Labs Limited
  - Duration: May 2020 to November 2020 - 6 months
  - Position: Software Developer (Intern)
  - About: Formal Verification of FPGA Cores For a Physics Experiment
  - Website: https://m-labs.hk
  - Areas: Python, FPGA programming
- BSD Academy (now BSD Education)
  - Duration: August 2016 (01/08/2016-14/08/2016) - 2 weeks
  - Position: Teaching Assistant
  - About: Assisting with teaching duties on HTML5+CSS3+JS
  - Website: https://bsd.education/
  - Areas: Education, Frontend Development

In my spare time, I like to ...

- Contribute to [Fedora test days](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Test_Days)
- Play old, nerdy games (ever heard of [Bookworm Adventures](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/05/11/bookworm-adventures-has-been-erased-from-the-internet-and-i-want-to-know-why/)?) on my Linux boxes using Wine
- Solve [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) Kata every once in a while or so
- Watch [Rick and Morty](https://www.rickandmorty.com/). I especially _love_ that Evil Morty plot (hint: profile picture ;-). Don't worry, I'm not a Rick in real life (okay maybe half of it ;-)
- Occasionally babble on about [interactive theorem proving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant). Ah, the good old days in academia ... ;-)

... and yeah, that's basically who I am. Feel free to request for my CV for additional information.
